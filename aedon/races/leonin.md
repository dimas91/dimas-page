# Leonin

The leonin are a proud race that have formed their own path since the dawn of civilization. Large and strong, leonin have historically been adept warriors, and physicality and power has played a central role in leonin society. After a long, bloody war that ended up with the decimation of the leonin race a long time ago, leonin had been relegated to the role of servants to the other races for a long time. It took another revolution for the leonin to take their freedom back, and with that reinstall themselves as one of the major races of Aedon. However, even though their packs and cities have found their previous glory again, the individuality and nomadism from their period of persecution has remained as a common way of living for a leonin, often guided by a strong desire to find a purpose in life.

## A Scattered Race

While the leonin originally settled in the cold north, the enslavement and persecution of leonin after the war caused them to scatter across the realm. The majority of leonin remains among the plains and lakes in the north, where their ancestral homes lie. This is also where pack mentality is still the strongest and old traditions of fierce pack loyalty still remain. These leonin tend to have lighter fur and longer hair and manes, and generally have a big, strong physical stature. Leonin who live in warmer places further south tend to have darker, shorter fur and have more lean bodies, as other societies have not pressured them to show physical prowess. As many leonin who were servants to other races lived among them for a long time, they have integrated and become a regular part of other societies as well.
