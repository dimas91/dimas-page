## A Brief Introduction to the History of the Realm of Aedon
###### as recorded by Arch-Maester Hal Vyrizh of Sanctuary

### The Old World
At the dawn of time, there were only the primal deities: Astor the Allfather, Vyta the Ur-Maiden, and Urzan the Darkbringer. Astor and Urzan were brothers, and they both wanted the hand of Vyta, so they fought for eternities, creating the stars from the sparks that flew during their battle. Eventually, Astor managed to defeat his brother, and then molded the empty world of Aedon from Urzan's broken shield, before banishing Urzan to stay on the other side of Aedon so they would never lay eyes on each other again.

Together, Astor and Vyta decided that Aedon would become the fruit of their love, and so they began sculpting the world and planting the seeds of life. During that time, they had children who would control the elements of Aedon, commonly known as The Five, namely Oryan, Myria, Zyrion, Phaerion, and Ilysia, gods of Earth, Water, Sky, Fire, and Nature respectively. They, in turn, created their own lesser gods, a pantheon of angels called The Many, who would serve as guardians and guides for Aedon.

### The Age of Heroes
Under the watchful eye of the gods, the early civilizations prospered and grew to great heights. In this time, Aedon itself was still wild and untamed, and other creatures grew strong and plentiful as well. Many of the tales from the Age of Heroes involve battles with dragons, giant monsters, powerful spirits, armies of undead, and mystical entities that were made from the world itself.

Over a long, long time, civilizations grew, and the dangers of primal Aedon grew smaller until they became a rarity. The dwarves of Westron had the streets of Gildhal lined with silver and gold. The elves of the east lived peaceful lives in their metropolis of Ilyen, harmonically interwoven into the forests of their home land. The Leonin lived peacefully on the Silent Flats, having tamed the wildlife that came before. The orcs in the south had an abundance of food that came from their fertile lands. And the humans at the center of it all thrived on the abundance of trade from the peace in the realm. 

### The Tyrant's Reign

As if the gods decided that their creations had to be punished for their splendor and grandeur, Aedon came alive again, and once again dragons, undead, and an abundance of fantastic beasts wandered the realm again. That's when the dragons, now commanded by a titanic being called the Tyrant, a powerful force of nature in the form of a dragon large enough to blot out Astor's light, began ripping apart civilization piece by piece. Even after many years of studying the Tyrant and its brood, scholars never established the origin and nature of this being.

With society crumbling, the armies of Aedon united and sent forth their best warriors and wizards to engage the Tyrant and its brood in combat on Astor's Seat, a sprawling highland high up in the mountains of the Shield, with a plan that would cost many lives at best, and would leave them defenseless at worst. The plan worked, and through a coordinated effort of combat, spells, and enchantments that required an army of wizards in their own regard, the Tyrant was pulled from the sky and defeated. With the power of the Arcane Legion and the blood of the Tyrant and the strongest champions of Aedon combined, a spell named The Great Veil was cast to dampen the power of magics in the world, so no such being would ever come into existence again.

### The Age of Reclamation
Under the protective power of The Veil, societies were rebuilt on the ruins of their ancestral halls. However, the sheer decimation caused by the reign of the Tyrant left the realm splintered and weak. Many wars were fought between different factions, and progress was slow. Eventually, society stabilized, some former glory was reclaimed, and the different kingdoms and empires flourished once more, although never rivaling their former glory. Over time, the Great Veil seemed to weaken, and more and more often there were sightings of the mystical, magical creatures of the past. Even though no dragons had been sighted since the fall of the Tyrant, the return of the natural dangers of Aedon left the realm with uncertainty and fear, and with that came war, and death. After realizing that fighting each other only left the factions of Aedon more vulnerable, truces were made and an uneasy coalition was formed to protect the realm. Even though the realm is at peace now, unrest is growing, the world is becoming more dangerous, and long forgotten roars can be heard again in the darkness.
