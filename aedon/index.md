## A Brief Introduction to the History of the Realm of Aedon
###### as recorded by Arch-Maester Hal Vyrizh of Sanctuary

### The Old World
At the dawn of time, there were only the primal deities: Astor, Urzan, and Vyta. Astor and Urzan were brothers who both wanted the hand of Vyta, so they fought one another for eons, creating the stars in the night sky from the sparks that flew from their battle. Eventually, Astor managed to defeat his brother, winning the hand of Vyta. Angry with his brother, Astor decided to take his broken shield and create Aedon from it to banish Urzan to the other side of Aedon, so Astor would never have to lay eyes on him again.

Together, Astor and Vyta decided that Aedon would become the fruit of their love, and so they began sculpting the world and planting the seeds of life. During that time, they had children who would control the primal elements of Aedon commonly known as The Five, namely Oryan, Myria, Zyrion, Phaerion, and Ilysia, gods of earth, water, sky, fire, and nature respectively. They, in turn, created their own lesser gods, a pantheon of angels we refer to as The Many, who would serve as guardians and guides for Aedon.

### The Age of Heroes
Under the watchful eye of the gods, the early people grew strong and spread across the realm. In this time Aedon itself was still wild and dangerous, and other creatures grew strong and plentiful as well. Many of the tales from the Age of Heroes involve battles with dragons, giant monsters, powerful spirits, armies of the undead, and mystical entities that were made from the world itself.

Over a long, long period of time, civilizations grew large and boundless and the dangerous beings of primal Aedon were slowly eradicated until they became a rarity. The dwarves of Westron had the streets of Gildhal lined with silver and gold. The elves of the east lived peaceful lives in their metropolis of Ilyen, harmonically interwoven into the forests of their home land. The Leonin lived peacefully on the Silent Flats, having tamed the wildlife that came before. The orcs in the south had an abundance of food that came from their fertile lands. And the humans at the center of it all thrived on the abundance of trade from the peace in the realm. 

### The Tyrant's Reign

As if the gods decided that their creations had to be punished for their splendor and grandeur, Aedon came alive again, and once again dragons, undead, and an abundance of fantastic beasts wandered the realm again. That's when the dragons, now commanded by a titanic being called the Tyrant, a powerful force of nature in the form of a dragon large enough to blot out Astor's light, began ripping apart civilization piece by piece. Even after many years of studying the Tyrant and its brood, scholars never established the origin and nature of this being.

With society crumbling, the armies of Aedon united and sent forth their best warriors and wizards to engage the Tyrant and its brood in combat on Astor's Seat, a sprawling highland high up in the mountains of the Shield, with a plan that would cost many lives at best, and would leave them defenseless at worst. The plan worked, and through a coordinated effort of combat, spells, and enchantments that required an army of wizards in their own regard, the Tyrant was pulled from the sky and defeated. With the power of the Arcane Legion and the blood of the Tyrant and the strongest champions of Aedon combined, a spell named The Great Veil was cast to dampen the power of magics in the world, so no such being would ever come into existence again.

### The Age of Reclamation
Under the protective power of The Veil, societies were rebuilt on the ruins of their ancestral halls. However, the sheer decimation caused by the reign of the Tyrant left the realm splintered and weak. Many wars were fought between different factions, and progress was slow. Eventually, society stabilized, some former glory was reclaimed, and the different kingdoms and empires flourished once more, although never rivaling their former glory. Over time, the Great Veil seemed to weaken, and more and more often there were sightings of the mystical, magical creatures of the past. Even though no dragons had been sighted since the fall of the Tyrant, the return of the natural dangers of Aedon left the realm with uncertainty and fear, and with that came war, and death. After realizing that fighting each other only left the factions of Aedon more vulnerable, truces were made and an uneasy coalition was formed to protect the realm. Even though the realm is at peace now, unrest is growing, the world is becoming more dangerous, and long forgotten cries can be heard again in the darkness.

## Geography

[Click here to see the map! (WIP)](https://i.imgur.com/4OptccH.jpg)

Aedon consists of 3 subcontinents: 
* **Westron**, a continent stretched from the icy north to the temperate south, with a mountain range along its entire spine. Used to be the land of the dwarves. The continent is split in half by a range of smaller mountains, leaving the continent split in northern and southern kingdoms.
* **Aedon**, the main continent in the center, which stretches all the way from frozen wastelands in the north to fiery mountains in the south. Aedon is kind of shaped like a bat wing, with the curved tip pointing south. The far north of Aedon consists of the **Crown of Aedon**, a largely unexplored uninhabited area because of the unforgiving cold. Smattered along the icy mountains are live volcanoes. South of the Crown lie **the Calm Lakes**, a vast tundra with many large lakes. This is where the leonin used to live, and many still do. Below the Flats Aedon is split in half by a mountain range called **the Shield** with similar relatively cold and wet climates, tough the east is drier than the west. South of the Shield lies another, smaller mountain range called **the Sword**, stretched from north to south. The Sword and the Shield are separated by a lush valley called **the Golden Belt**, named after its rolling fields of wheat, and the gold that was gained from the east-west trade route. To the east of the Golden Belt lie **the Riverlands**, a large stretch of mountains, forests, and fields with large rivers passing through. On the western side of the Golden Belt lies the city of **Vantys**, capital city of the Empire, the center of most trade routes and the current seat of the Coalition. To the South of the Shield lie **the Dark Marshes**, a large marsh-like, heavily forested area with an abundance of rivers and lakes, home of the orcs. Even further south lie **the Ashen Fields**, a vast desert bordered by a mountain range called **the Fangs** to the south east, which stretches all the way to the southern tip of Aedon.
* **Ilysia and Ar√°ha**, also known as the Green Isles because of their vast, ancient forests, are a pair of continents to the east, traditionally the homeland of the elves. In the center of Ilysia (named after the goddess) lies a tall mountain called the Spire of Ilysia.

Aedon and Westron are separated by a sea which is used for trade and travel. In between Aedon and Westron lie a number of large islands called the **Fork Isles**, a largely lawless region inhabited by merchants and pirates alike. The sea between the Green Isles and Aedon is calmer, and also has a few islands, though smaller and lesser than in the west.


## For RPGs

Aedon can be used as a typical high fantasy setting.

### Classes [see SRD](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Classes%20by%20Name)

* **Barbarian**: Think Conan. They wear little to no armour, are savage and brutal melee combatants that are incredibly tough to take down when they fly into a combat rage (potentially the toughest to kill of all classes).
* **Bard**: Magical minstrel. They cast spells that buff the party or hinder enemies and are generally the most adapt at both high and low social situations due to their musical entertaining skills. Also very entertaining to play yourself.
* **Cleric**: Clerics are spellcasters who follow a deity, have a buff-heavy spell list with major abilities themed to their deity, and can choose to either be frontline melee fighters or backline spellcasters. Can heal as well.
* **Druid**: Natural healers or vicious shape shifters. In tune with the wild druids can serve as party healers or take the form of animals to engage in combat.
* **Fighter**: Heavily armed and armoured melee or ranged combatants. Trained in all weapons, armour and shields fighters can deal damage, take damage and defend the party.
* **Monk**: Incredibly skilled spiritual warriors that can engage in melee combat. While they won't be doing as much damage as say a Paladin or Fighter they have a massive array of debilitating effects to disrupt enemies.
* **Paladin**: Holy melee warriors. Heavily clad in armour Paladins can do some modest healing like a lite-Cleric but focus more on smiting evil through holy spells and melee combat. Additionally, Paladins command respect for many classes in society and make excellent social characters.
* **Ranger**: Ranged or melee hunters adept at surviving in the wilds. They can cast moderate amount of spells and are especially knowledgable about specific creatures and types of terrain.
* **Rogue**: *Not thieves:* Rogues. Trained (self or otherwise) in underhanded tactics such as sneaking, stealing, picking pockets and locks, disable and setting traps. They fight with guile rather than strength. They can also be a smooth-talker depending on how they are made. Nobody will have a set of skills as diverse as the Rogue. Think Jack Sparrow or Han Solo.
* **Sorcerer**: A natural spell caster. Where Wizards train Sorcerers have spellcasting in their blood. They are often ranged damage dealers but can also be healers. Their natural abilities also make them naturally good in dealing socially with people making them great party faces.
* **Warlock**: While Sorcerers have spellcasting as a natural ability and Wizards train Warlocks make a pact with a powerful being in exchange for power. This pact is often for good but can also be for evil. Like Sorcerers they make good party faces.
* **Wizard**: Nobody can match the diversity of a wizards spellbook and years of training. Their spells often make them the most powerful burst damage dealers in combat and their knowledge of Arcane lore and History are useful in many situations.
* **[Geomancer](http://dimas.io/aedon/classes/geomancer)**: Custom class, basically a high fantasy earthbender wizard.
