### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four Cantrips of your choice from the Geomancer spell list. You learn an additional Geomancer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.

### Spell Slots

The Geomancer table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Geomancer Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Burning Hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Burning Hands using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level Spells of your choice from the Geomancer spell list.

You learn an additional Geomancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Geomancer Spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Geomancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your Spellcasting ability for your Geomancer Spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your Spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when Setting the saving throw DC for a Geomancer spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
Spell Attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a Spellcasting focus for your Geomancer Spells.

## Sorcerous Origin
Your sorcerous Origin grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

## Font of Magic
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

### Sorcery Points
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a Long Rest.

### Flexible Casting
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional Spell Slots, or sacrifice Spell Slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

#### Creating Spell Slots. 
You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a Bonus Action on Your Turn. The created Spell Slots Vanish at the end of a Long Rest. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create Spell Slots no higher in level than 5th.

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 1st              | 2                  |
| 2nd              | 3                  |
| 3rd              | 5                  |
| 4th              | 6                  |
| 5th              | 7                  |

#### Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. 
As a Bonus Action on Your Turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.

## Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your Spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### Careful Spell
When you Cast a Spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spellâ€™s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

### Distant Spell
When you Cast a Spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you Cast a Spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

### Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell
When you Cast a Spell that has a Duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its Duration, to a maximum Duration of 24 hours.

### Heightened Spell
When you Cast a Spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

### Quickened Spell
When you Cast a Spell that has a Casting Time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the Casting Time to 1 Bonus Action for this casting.

### Subtle Spell
When you Cast a Spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal Components.

### Twinned Spell
When you Cast a Spell that Targets only one creature and doesnâ€™t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spellâ€™s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spellâ€™s current level. For example, Magic Missile and Scorching Ray arenâ€™t eligible, but Ray of Frost is.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Sorcerous Restoration
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a Short Rest.

## Sorcerous Origins - Stone Sorcery
Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic of elemental earth. Your link to earth magic grants you extraordinary resilience, and geomancers have a natural affinity for combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and geomancers have a knack for wielding both shields and weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to overwhelm your foes.

### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.

### Cave Sense
You gain an added +2 proficiency bonus to Perception checks while in caves.

### Mineral Munching
Once a day, you can use your action to eat a gem to gain a temporary ability. The type of gem decides the type of ability which can be found in the table below, and the size of the gem determines the duration, where you can choose between eating a gem fragment (1/3 of a gem) for a duration of 1 hour or an entire gem for a duration of 8 hours. After you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you complete a long rest.

| Gem Type         | Ability |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Azurite          | Cold Damage Resistance   |
| Malachite        | Protection from Poison   |
| Rhodochrosite    | Fire Damage Resistance   |
| Obsidian         | Acid Damage Resistance   |
| Citrine          | Lightning Damage Resistance|
| Tiger's Eye      | Darkvision               |
| Sapphire         | Water Breathing          |
| Diamond          | Magic Resistance         |

### Stoneâ€™s Durability
At 1st level, your connection to stone gives you extra fortitude. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. As an action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Constitution modifier if you arenâ€™t wearing armor, and your skin assumes a stony appearance. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield.

### Stone Aegis
Starting at 6th level, your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your alliesâ€™ protection. As a bonus action, you can grant an aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The aegis is a dim, gray aura of earth magic that protects the target. Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your geomancer level divided by 4. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated. In addition, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. You can teleport only if you and the attacker are on the same surface. You can then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d10 force damage. This extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 17th level.

### Stoneâ€™s Edge
Starting at 14th level, your mastery of earth magic allows you to add the force of elemental earth to your spells. When you cast a spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the round you cast it. That creature takes extra force damage equal to half your Geomancer level. This feature can be used only once per casting of a spell.

### Earth Masterâ€™s Aegis
Beginning at 18th level, when you use your Stoneâ€™s Aegis to protect an ally, you can choose up to three creatures to gain its benefits.
